# 🚀 Admin Analytics Implementation - Phase 1-4

## Status: STARTING

**Target:** Complete Usage Monitoring + System Health tabs (Phase 1-4)  
**Excluding:** Phase 5 (Real-time WebSocket - too heavy)  
**Timeline:** ~3-4 hours of implementation

---

## What We're Building

### ✅ Phase 1: Core Analytics (MVP)
- Dashboard cards with aggregate metrics
- Study time line chart
- Student usage table
- Basic time range selector
- System Health tab with basic metrics

### ✅ Phase 2: Advanced Visualizations
- Peak usage hours bar chart
- Feature usage pie chart
- Daily active users chart
- Device breakdown chart
- System load chart and performance graphs

### ✅ Phase 3: Individual Student View
- Student detail page
- Activity timeline
- Engagement patterns
- Individual charts and trends

### ✅ Phase 4: Export & Reports
- CSV export
- PDF reports (basic)
- System health reports

### ❌ Phase 5: Real-time Updates (SKIPPED)
- WebSocket integration - too heavy
- Live metric updates - not needed
- We'll use 30-second polling instead for lightweight updates
